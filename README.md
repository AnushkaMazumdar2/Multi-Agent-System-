# Multi-Agent System Using Crewai: Trip Itinerary Generator

In today’s fast-paced world, planning a vacation can be both exciting and overwhelming. With numerous destinations, activities, and logistics to consider, travelers often struggle to create a well-organized itinerary that maximizes their experience. Our project addresses this challenge by developing an advanced travel itinerary generator using CrewAI. This system leverages the capabilities of multi-agent systems to create personalized, day-wise travel plans based on user inputs.

The primary goal of our project is to simplify the travel planning process by offering a tailored itinerary that reflects individual preferences and interests. By inputting basic information such as the traveler’s name, destination, and a link to a website with tourist attractions, users can receive a comprehensive and customized travel plan. This approach not only saves time but also ensures that travelers make the most of their trip, exploring key attractions and activities aligned with their interests.
